# Trip Planning API

This project provides a FastAPI-based backend that helps users plan trips. The API allows users to input a trip description, and it automatically generates a trip plan, including flight options, weather forecasts, and other essential details. The service utilizes OpenAI's ChatGPT to extract key information from user input, and integrates with flight and weather APIs for real-time data.

## Features

- **Trip Plan Generation**: Users can describe their trip (e.g., destination, dates), and the API will return a complete trip plan, including:
  - **Flights**: Flight options for the given trip.
  - **Weather**: Weather forecast for the destination.
  - **Description**: A short, human-readable description of the trip.
  
- **Date Validation**: Ensures that the trip's start and end dates are in the future and correctly formatted.

- **IATA Code Handling**: Automatically converts location names to IATA codes for destinations and origins.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- FastAPI
- Uvicorn (for running the server)
- OpenAI API key (for ChatGPT interaction)
- Flight API key (for flight information)
- Weather API key (for weather forecast)

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/yourusername/trip-planning-api.git
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
  ```bash
    cd trip-planning-api
    pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```
3. Set up your API keys:

For ChatGPT, set your OpenAI API key in the openai_helper.py file.
For flight and weather information, set your API keys in the respective service files (flights.py, weather.py).

```
OPENWEATHER_API_KEY = ""
AMADEUS_CLIENT_ID = ""
AMADEUS_CLIENT_SECRET = ""
OPENAI_API_KEY = "your-api-key"
```
Running the Application
To start the API server, run:

  ```bash
    uvicorn main:app --reload
  ```
 This will start the server on http://127.0.0.1:8000, and you can start making requests to the /plan_trip endpoint.
